Just a player, music and video player that's for Linux, Windows, MacOS. I'm so tired of ugly designed players on Linux distros and video loop of broken link on VLC player. 
Melo as short for mellow and melody.

Current stage:
29.09.2022 - Player can play videos and music, also unplanned added functionlity to view images is being worked on. Dark mode is working

To do:
Build Tauri app, improve design, configure tabs for loaded images, fix image dragging when zoomed in
